# Reverse String

Tier: **Grey**

## Task

Reverse the character order. Inputs contain ASCII characters and are non-null; preserve spaces and punctuation.

Edit `Solution.cs`. `Tests.cs` contains executable examples; read it before coding and add your own cases after solving.

From this exercise's folder:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

`dotnet run` builds automatically and executes `Tests.cs` against your solution. After building, use `dotnet run --no-build` to skip compilation when the code has not changed.

Alternatively, from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/run.ps1 reverse-string
```

## Work through it

1. Trace a small input on paper.
2. Describe a straightforward approach in your own words.
3. Implement it; use a debugger or temporary prints when stuck.
4. Run the checks and add an edge case.
5. Record time and extra-space complexity in `notes.md`.

Read from the last index toward zero. Consider a char array.

Checks verify selected examples, not every possible input or the required complexity. Review the algorithm as well as the output.
