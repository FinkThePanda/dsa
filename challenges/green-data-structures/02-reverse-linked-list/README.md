# Reverse Linked List

Tier: **Green**

## Task

Reverse a singly linked list in place, returning its new head. Reuse nodes. Null input returns null.

Edit `Solution.cs`. `Tests.cs` contains executable examples; read it before coding and add your own cases after solving.

From this exercise's folder:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

`dotnet run` builds automatically and executes `Tests.cs` against your solution. After building, use `dotnet run --no-build` to skip compilation when the code has not changed.

Alternatively, from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/run.ps1 reverse-linked-list
```

## Work through it

1. Trace a small input on paper.
2. Describe a straightforward approach in your own words.
3. Implement it; use a debugger or temporary prints when stuck.
4. Run the checks and add an edge case.
5. Record time and extra-space complexity in `notes.md`.

Save the next node before changing its Next reference.

Checks verify selected examples, not every possible input or the required complexity. Review the algorithm as well as the output.
